# Vim, My Way
This is my personal set of customizations and plugins. I have this set up to be as cross-platform as possible and to be entirely git-driven.

## Installation instructions

### Windows
1. Install [git](https://git-scm.com/download), then [vim](http://www.vim.org/download.php).
2. Clone into a temp folder: `git clone https://github.com/wesrupert/vim C:\Users\<YOU>\vimfiles`
3. Run the associated setup script: `.\setup.cmd`.
