# Ora's vim bundle

## A set of customizations for speedy development
This is the GVim setup I use on Windows Systems. Feel free to use it!

## Notable customizations

## Notable plugins
This bundle contains multiple plugins. The most noteworthy (or the ones that have extra commands) are listed here.

### [CtrlP.vim](https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim)
This plugin allows for fuzzy file searching to open documents. Use __<leader>/__ to call :CtrlP (invokes find file mode), then use these commands:
* __<f5>__: Refresh
* __<c-f> <c-b>__: Cycle modes
* __<c-d>__: Filename only search (don't use path)
* __<c-r>__: Regexp mode
* __<c-y>__: Create new file
* __<c-z> -> <c-o>__: Select multiple files, then open them all

### [vim-easymotion](https://github.com/Lokaltog/vim-easymotion)
This plugin allows you to select which result of a motion to use, rather than having to prepend a number beforehand. Just prepend <leader><leader> to a motion, and the results will be displayed afterward!
